          When you purchase a lottery ticket by pressing the Buy button on the
          top page, required mock tokens will be sent to the lottery contract.

          Once you get MockToken, you can buy tickets by pressing the Buy button
          on the top page. To allow the transfer of MockToken, you need to
          approve the lottery contract to spend the MockToken before calling
          lottery contract, so Metamask prompt will be shown twice. Please
          confirm both of them.
